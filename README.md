MAKE SURE TO HAVE PROXIFIER SET UP, WHERE YOUR PROFILES ARE NAMED AFTER YOUR CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS/DELIVERY TEAMS,
e.g. 'DELIVERY_TEAM-IAM.ppx', IN THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORY: ~/Library/Application Support/Proxifier/Profiles/{}.ppx'

Repo created for the C4A event


Problem Statement:
The advent and adoption of UAT has lead to increased security for both internal and client-facing accounts, yet the current state is sorely lacking automation.

While Ansible is being considered as an effective and simple approach to solving this, the downside is all accounts must get approval before creating and installing Ansible IDs, and most clients are un-willing to let a fully automated script control their system.


Solution:
Empower individuals with the tool necessary to expedite workflows and maximize savings in DevOps cycle time.

This full featured GUI application is intended to be used by Primary Controls in IAM to reduce turn-around time on ID creation, modification, and deletion.


The setup is very simple and the only inconvenience, is that it currently run on Mac only, with Proxifier as the software used for switching between SOCKS profiles.


Will continue to make modifications to this readme and the software in general, for the duration of my job role.
It is my hope this software not only helps the lives of my fellow IAM department, but that the password/RSA/hosts file manager also helps out all System Admins.

It is my hope that this software will also help in the adoption and learning of UAT, as we currently lack integration between IAM and the rest of GTS.
